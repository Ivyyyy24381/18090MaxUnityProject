# 18090MaxUnityProject
For the final project, I connected Max with Unity Game Engine and created a mini interaction game. Communication between Max and Unity is established using extOSC(Open Sound Control Protocol: https://github.com/Iam1337/extOSC). Max is the sender and Unity is the receiver in this project. I created a maxpatch that is used as the controller to control a ball rolling and jumping in unity. In Max, the player can either send a bang, or adjust the frequency of a cycle~ to control ball movement. Once the ball collide with randomly generated cubes in the game mode, the player gains a point, which is displayed in the upper left corner of the game. The player also has the flexibility to change the gameplay time and cube generation speed to adjust the difficulty level.
